This is a virtual reality demonstration made in Unity by Tanner Samples. To play, open the "DEMO_IS_IN_HERE folder" and run "XRI Examples". This only works on Windows.

The project is a virtual reality simulation, so instead of a VR headset and gaming controller(s) it uses a standard monitor, mouse, and keyboard.

The controls are listed in the game itself, but some important ones to note are:
* Move the player with WASD
* Rotate the camera with mouse movement
* Toggle left controller mode with "T"
* Press button with "G" (note you must be aiming the controller at a buttton)

All these features were made by Unity in their VR sample project availible here under the Unity Companion License https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/XR-Interaction-Toolkit-Examples

My role was to set up a scene demonstating a human character switching between IDLE, WALK, and JUMP animations using three buttons.
To accomplish this I made use of button assets in the project to call a PlayAnimation function in my AnimatorController script.

The human character models and animations are from the Unity Asset Store https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/low-poly-3d-animated-club-dancer-168604
